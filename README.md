### Hi there 👋 I'm Alex Dunn aka SuavePirate 🏴‍☠️ 

I'm the head of product and principal architect at Voicify with a focus on App Dev, AI, and Accessibility.
I also speak at conferences around the world to teach other developers how to make the most of their skills to solve problems in new ways!

You can check out my blog posts and series at https://suavepirate.com or catch me on twitch every now and then when I'm streaming building cool AI and accessibility tech at twitch.tv/suave_pirate


I'm also hiring for my team at Voicify! Checkout open dev positions at https://voicify.com/careers
